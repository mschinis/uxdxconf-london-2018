# UXDX Conference London 2018

**Highlight bottlenecks** - Optimise the whole, not the parts
- Shared vision
    - Why: Shared vision helps both UX and Developers work towards the same goal
    - How: Sticky notes with all stakeholders and team members
    - **Jobs to be done framework**
        - Focus on customer and their need. Talk all about the features, but if a user wants a hole in the wall, they don't care about the drill features.
        - Shift thinking from products to customers
    - **Event storming**
        - Technology team initiated
        - Focus on understanding the user process
- UX/DX barriers
    - Get the whole team together.
    - Work together on shared vision to eliminate misscommunication
- Quick feedback
    - Outcome focus
        - Everything can be broken down if you ask the right questions.
    - DevOps

**Outcomes** - From applying the UXDX model
- Product ownership model is changed
- Metrics everywhere. Why, why, why?
    - Why are we doing this?
    - If there's no metric, what's the value of it?
- Problems agreed
    - Solutions not there, but problems agreed.
    - "Everybody loves progress but nobody likes change"

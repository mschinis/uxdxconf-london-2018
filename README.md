**Highlight bottlenecks** - Optimise the whole, not the parts
- Shared vision
    - Why: Shared vision helps both UX and Developers work towards the same goal
    - How: Sticky notes with all stakeholders and team members
    - **Jobs to be done framework**
        - Focus on customer and their need. Talk all about the features, but if a user wants a hole in the wall, they don't care about the drill features.
        - Shift thinking from products to customers
    - **Event storming**
        - Technology team initiated
        - Focus on understanding the user process
- UX/DX barriers
    - Get the whole team together.
    - Work together on shared vision to eliminate misscommunication
- Quick feedback
    - Outcome focus
        - Everything can be broken down if you ask the right questions.
    - DevOps

**Outcomes** - From applying the UXDX model
- Product ownership model is changed
- Metrics everywhere. Why, why, why?
    - Why are we doing this?
    - If there's no metric, what's the value of it?
- Problems agreed
    - Solutions not there, but problems agreed.
    - *"Everybody loves progress but nobody likes change"*

- Manual tests
    - Misconceptions
        1. Speed & Cost: Usually it's cheaper to explain something in person than code it
    - Bad
        1. Single point of failure
        2. Limited scope
        3. Fatigue
        4. Not perfectly reproducible
- Automated tests
    - Achieve more
    - It can be much more interesting
    - Controlled environment - Always reproducible
- Don't underestimate manual testers
    - Anything that requires users to use, a user should test
- Automation should not totally replace manual test
- Encourage automated tests and users to understand automated tests

- *"To build great products, start by building a great team."*
    - Empower your employees
        - Give people data and easy access to the data to make decisions
    - Foster responsibility
        - Let people know of their responsibility with the data
        - Grow a blameless culture
    - Let builders build
    - Go cross-functional
        - Build teams that can deliver everything across the stack.
- What is going wrong, the wrong way?
    - Building things on a whim that you have to support forever
    - Locking yourself to architectural decisions
    - Building things that are hard to remove
    - Building things that are hard to build on top of
- What is going wrong the right way?
    - Being experiment-driven
        - Have a hypothesis / goal metrics
        - Build enough to test it (MV(iable)P vs ML(ovable)P)
        - Don't get attached to products *- Easier said than done*
- How can we go wrong the right way?
    - Planning
        - Engineers: Time spent planning is not wasted
        - When building an MVP, plan the whole feature, then cut it back
        - Decide on your success criteria before launching
    - Go backwards
        - Experiment quickly, kill ruthlessly
        - A negative experiment is not a failure, celebrate them
        - People care, but not as much as you think
        - Don't be afraid to stick to your vision
    - Have a north star
        - Know where you want your product to be in the future
        - Watch out for feature creep, especially 'quick fixes'
        - Make sure you're measuring the *right* thing

**Highlight bottlenecks** - Optimise the whole, not the parts
- Shared vision
    - Why: Shared vision helps both UX and Developers work towards the same goal
    - How: Sticky notes with all stakeholders and team members
    - **Jobs to be done framework**
        - Focus on customer and their need. Talk all about the features, but if a user wants a hole in the wall, they don't care about the drill features.
        - Shift thinking from products to customers
    - **Event storming**
        - Technology team initiated
        - Focus on understanding the user process
- UX/DX barriers
    - Get the whole team together.
    - Work together on shared vision to eliminate misscommunication
- Quick feedback
    - Outcome focus
        - Everything can be broken down if you ask the right questions.
    - DevOps

**Outcomes** - From applying the UXDX model
- Product ownership model is changed
- Metrics everywhere. Why, why, why?
    - Why are we doing this?
    - If there's no metric, what's the value of it?
- Problems agreed
    - Solutions not there, but problems agreed.
    - *"Everybody loves progress but nobody likes change"*

- Why do we need UX Research?
    - To create & deliver a great product by discovering the client and their needs
- Sprint phases
    - Discover
        - Field studdy
        - User interview
        - Steakholder interviews
    - Explore
        - Competitive analysis
        - Design review
        - Journey mapping & write user stories
    - Test
        - Usability testing
        - Benchmark testing
    - Listen
        - Survey
        - Analytics review
        - Usability testing
- Disagreements - 2 reasons why people disagree with a research study
    1. Their own research shows something different
    2. or their personal opinions differ from research recommendations

- Manual tests
    - Misconceptions
        1. Speed & Cost: Usually it's cheaper to explain something in person than code it
    - Bad
        1. Single point of failure
        2. Limited scope
        3. Fatigue
        4. Not perfectly reproducible
- Automated tests
    - Achieve more
    - It can be much more interesting
    - Controlled environment - Always reproducible
- Don't underestimate manual testers
    - Anything that requires users to use, a user should test
- Automation should not totally replace manual test
- Encourage automated tests and users to understand automated tests

- *"To build great products, start by building a great team."*
    - Empower your employees
        - Give people data and easy access to the data to make decisions
    - Foster responsibility
        - Let people know of their responsibility with the data
        - Grow a blameless culture
    - Let builders build
    - Go cross-functional
        - Build teams that can deliver everything across the stack.
- What is going wrong, the wrong way?
    - Building things on a whim that you have to support forever
    - Locking yourself to architectural decisions
    - Building things that are hard to remove
    - Building things that are hard to build on top of
- What is going wrong the right way?
    - Being experiment-driven
        - Have a hypothesis / goal metrics
        - Build enough to test it (MV(iable)P vs ML(ovable)P)
        - Don't get attached to products *- Easier said than done*
- How can we go wrong the right way?
    - Planning
        - Engineers: Time spent planning is not wasted
        - When building an MVP, plan the whole feature, then cut it back
        - Decide on your success criteria before launching
    - Go backwards
        - Experiment quickly, kill ruthlessly
        - A negative experiment is not a failure, celebrate them
        - People care, but not as much as you think
        - Don't be afraid to stick to your vision
    - Have a north star
        - Know where you want your product to be in the future
        - Watch out for feature creep, especially 'quick fixes'
        - Make sure you're measuring the *right* thing

- Why TDD? (Test Driven Development)
    - Implicitly create and maintain a regression test suite that lets you know immediately if something breaks
- The TDD cycle
    - Write test that describes the functionality
    - Make smallest change to make the test pass
    - Restructure the code is written
- Why ATDD (Acceptance Test Driven Development)
    - Shared understanding
    - Shared ownership
    - Test first approach
    - Results in: High quality software
- Shared understanding
    - There are no heroes *- The team is responsible*
    - Everyone should feel a collective sense of pride
    - There is no 'dev complete' - it's done when all stakeholders are happy
    - There are no second class citizens in a high-trust team
    - How do we make sure everyone understand what's required?
        - Write requirements in a common format (Given-When-Then)
        - Use ubiquitous language *- Explain exactly what a requirement means*
        - Talk to people
- The ATDD cycle
    - Discuss
        - Team asks questions
        - Break down the feature
        - May add new features
        - Should establish a shared understanding
    - Distil
        - Formalise the acceptance criteria
        - Use ubiquitous language
        - Don't include implementation details
        - Feature should now be ready to sprint
    - Develop
        - Transform ubiquitous language into tests
        - Add technical scenarios
    - Demo
        - Already know it meets the requirements
        - May perform exploratory testing
- The big picture
    1. idea
    2. prototype
    3. test
    4. backlog
    5. build
    6. measure
    7. iterate

- How to build products that people love
    1. Identify big opportunities
        - There's always massive opportunities in the market. Focus on current or future trends. Big problems.
        - e.g. saving money, easy access to crypto, global medical I.D, Mass transportation
    2. Understand the problem
        - Be the best in that domain. You need to have more knowledge than 10 year old experts. Dig deeper to the root of the problem.
        - e.g. International money transfers, Why is it hard to solve?, How does the market work?
    3. Design a solution that's 100x better
        - People tend to overvalue their existing solution by 10x
        - Companies tend to overvalue their solution by 10x
    4. Build virality into your product
        - Always think about how to leverage the network of your customers and partners
        - Hyper growth companies are able to leverage the network effect to accelerate their growth
        - e.g. Waiting list, Feature unlock, Referral systems, Partnerships
    5. Create an engagement strategy
        - Communication is one of the most important parts of every product
        - Never forget to think about the entire user journey
        - e.g. Feature adoption, Feature engagement, Feature re-engagement
    6. Announce it big-time
        - Every bigger product launch at Revolut goes through a standardised process for launch.
        - This includes PR, Website, Blog, Social Media, Email Newsletter, Push notifications, Campaigns
